# AnesFC
Motivated by clinical needs, we conducted a comprehensive study to explore the effects of anesthesia on cortical functional connectivity at an individual level. 
Our study involved individualized functional analyses of resting-state fMRI data from 14 healthy participants, encompassing both awake and anesthetized states. 
Importantly, each participant underwent extensive 96-minute fMRI scanning, enabling us to capture robust anesthesia-induced changes at the individual level. 

We observed reduced connectivity during anesthesia compared to the awake state, particularly within unimodal networks and across various between-network interactions, 
indicating a weakened functional integration. Although anesthesia diminished individual differences in functional connectivity, we found that subject-specific functional 
connectivity fingerprints were well-preserved. To mitigate the effects of anesthesia on brain connectivity, we developed a predictive model that accurately reconstructs 
functional connectomes in the awake state using data collected under anesthesia. We demonstrated the model's ability to identify disease-specific dysfunctions using data f
rom 29 anesthetized children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
